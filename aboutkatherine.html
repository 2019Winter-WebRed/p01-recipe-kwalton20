        <h1>All About Katherine</h1> 
        <hr/>
        <p>My name is Katherine. I'm a junior at Padua. My favorite movie is <i> The breakfast club</i>I am the only person in my family that has ever gone to Padua and my mom and my grandma were both so happy when they found out I got in. <blockquote> smile <blockquote>I have a great group of friends and hang out with them a lot over the weekends. I enjoy school, my favorite subject is Psychology, I find it <b>interesting<b>. I do struugle in school a lot because I have ADHD and get distracted easily. In the future I would love to become an NICU nurse and work with premature babies because I love kids.</p>
        <p>I am an only child and it's just me and my mom at home, I have a relatively small family but I have a lot of baby cousins. I have 3 baby girl cousins and 3 boy cousins. Me and my mom have a very strong bond because we rely on eachother. My mom is a teacher at a special needs school. My grandparents are from england, they immagrated here when they were in there thirties. We take a trip to North Carolina every year and we have since I was five. It's my favorite family tradition.</p>
        <p>I have three pets, one dog, one cat and a guinea pig. My dogs name is Boris and he is a German Sheaperd corgi mix. My cats name is Bailey and he is very mean and likes to attack me, however he does have his sweet moments. He is an orange tabby cat. My guinea pigs name is bubbles and she is brown and fat. My cats favorite food is butter. In the future I would love to travel around the world and be introduced to many different cultures, and visit a lot of beaches because I love the beach.<p>
